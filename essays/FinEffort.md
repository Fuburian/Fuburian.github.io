<h1>Effort Estimation: Putting the F in Effort</h1>
<p>
	If putting in effort was a class, I'd get an F. Not because I didn't put in effort, but because I put in effort and made minimal progress, at least compared to my peers. Allow me to explain, I refuse to use AI in a learning environment, and that's 
not from a lack of trying. I have tried to use Generative AI on my assignments, but I have found it to be disappointing at best when it comes to my studies. That's not to say it isn't useful, far from it. It is extremely useful and saves a lot of time when
 utilized correctly. In a production environment, I would be more than willing to use AI to help overcome certain obstacles, but in a learning environment? It doesn't help much. Over the years, I have discovered that I learn best through experience. Lectures are nice, 
they provide pre "distilled" information, but the bulk of my learning comes from exercises and homework. I'm a self-learner. I will, of course, ask questions if I am stuck or confused. However, AI doesn't really help with that. It can't reliably provide me with extra practice problems, and it really code without resembling that one pigeon guided bomb invented towards the end of WWII. Yeah, training pigeons to peck at images of enemy warships works, but barely! It's the most roundabout cockamamie method to get a bomb from point A to point B. I digress, I have found I learn more through experience, so experience I will.

This brings me to another point: motivation. I have more motivation if I am having fun. Of course I've been told "you can't always have fun!" Why can't I? just like time management: If people have no time, then they make time. If I my work isn't fun, then I will make it fun. Using AI to complete my assignmets is not fun, but writting and submitting a medieval scroll for my homework is fun. Even in programming, I find ways to have fun by adding a bit of personality into my comments. Today, I have declared a war on the word "fair": "This
scheduling algorithm isn't fair"? How about "This scheduling algorithm practices poor shareability". I will, of course, explain what I meant by "shareability" within the comment itself. Write an essay on colonialism? Sure thing! Here's an essay about colonialism and how this particular random Japanese Anime is a prime example of settler colonialism. At most, I would use AI as a tool to throw at a very specific problem. "How do I itterate over this struct". It should NOT replace the main proccess of the work itself.
