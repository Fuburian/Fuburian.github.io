# How to be Racist: A Quick Guide for the Socially Impaired

My disappointment is immeseaurable and my day is ruined. that is how I feel about this article, if it could even be called such. It reads more like an enlightened racist's manifesto on minorities than an actual guide on smart question asking. I can barely bring myself to even write about this tirade, because of the sheer distaste it leaves in my mouth. First off, you do not call people seeking help "losers". 
Secondly, Mr. Raymond has completely disregarded the various circumstances people find themselves in. Thirdly, the actual commentary used in this article *reeks* of racism.

Yes, I remember very well when my first grade teacher called me a loser for asking why 3 by 3 was 9. By utilizing this type of analogy, Mr. Raymond has cleanly divided people into two distinct groups: "The acceptable" and the "Undesireable" and has whole heartedly commented that one is inferior to the other. "In particular, we throw away questions from people who appear to be losers in order to spend our question-answering time more efficiently, on winners." 
  
   > "We're not asking you to genuflect to us â€” in fact, most of us would love nothing more than to deal with you as an equal and welcome you into our culture, if you put in the effort required to make that possible."

We're not asking you to worship us as superiors, we would love nothing more for you to be civilized! This *person* writes as if the technologically inclined are a benevolent higher power with a mission to enlighten and civilize the new world savages. Here they establish a *clear* hierarchy that details a class of inferior users that have to *put in effort* to be considered "equal", completely neglecting that some people may be less fortunate than others. Some people may not have neither the time nor freedom to invest into Software Engineering. Let's not forget that Mr. Raymond has said  "Gays experimented with unfettered promiscuity in the 1970s and got AIDS as a consequence".

  Mr. Raymond kindly offers us a compliment. "Good Question!" Wow, thanks!
