<h1>Design Paterns: The Tetris of the Computer World</h1>
<p>If Software Development was Tetris, then Design Patterns are the blocks. At least, that's how I like to think of them. They're nifty litte tools we cann use to get a job done. We use them as construction blocks to build our program or application (or solution if you're daring). Much like the blocks in Tetris, Design Patterns are incomplete on their own and require further work to bring out their true potential. When reviewing or drafting a design for a solution, we may come accross "T Block" shaped holes. This would be an indication to use a "T Block" to plug the hole. Let's say I want to create a front end to a database where users can add items and entries to the various tables. This would look like a very "Factory" shaped hole. Of course, like Tetris, there could be many Design Patterns to fit the bill. However, each and every Design Pattern has its own banes and boons. Yes, you could plug a vertical hole with an "L Block", but that would block the column and make further developments impossible. Similarly, one could use "Observer" to send news letters to subscribers, but good luck getting that to work reliably on multi-threaded computers. You don't have a semaphore! So naturally, this could go horribly wrong if you use the wrong Design Pattern for the job. To quote College Humor, "The playing field is random and jagged". </p>

	Is a crime that should have been outlawed by the Geneva Convention. However, that's also what makes JavaScript (and by extension, Typescript) so convenient—it allows for simple code that, to quote Todd Howard, "Just works". Grievances aside, Typescript is a good language for beginners. Unlike the double-egded sword that is C, Typescript is less likely to segment fault and brick your script. It has native class support which is very helpful in regards to Object Oriented Programming. The Type extension is very usefull for programmers who like to keep their functions organized, but to be honnest, it sort of just feels like an extra layer added to JavaScript to make it more like languages like C (where every variable and function has to have a type).

In regards to athletic software engineering, I actively despise it. That's just my personal opinion. I'm sure it works for some people, and if it does then I'm glad they found something that works for them. Personally, I do not believe good quality programming could come from forcing programmers to conform to a timelimit. Stress aside, I tend to write and simulate code in my head several times before I actually start coding. It's essential to my coding process and removing that would be akin to kicking the crutch out from beneath a limping patient. Sure, I could use a naive implementation of the WOD, but at that point, I'm not really practicing my coding skills or critical thinking. I'm just brute forcing a program without regard to dynamic programming or cost functions. I think WODs would be useful for programmers who are still developing their programming skill set and are a fun way to keep your skills sharp, but it ends there. To borrow horse racing terms, I am an "end closer". That is, I spend majority of my time thinking, researching, planning, and then complete projects in a flurry of energy and activity. WODs are inherently antithetical to my work routine, but that's just my personal opinion.
